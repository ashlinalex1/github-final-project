# github-final-project
#I recently joined a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities for low-income individuals. 
Our core team currently relies on Subversion (SVN) for managing code, and we are looking to gradually transition to Git. 
As part of this transition, I've been tasked with hosting our sample code for calculating simple interest on GitHub.
In this initial step, I aim not only to host the script but also to implement best practices introduced in my training.
I'll create supporting documents for the open-source project, including a code of conduct and contribution guidelines.
Additionally, I plan to make the repository available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.
I believe this move will set the foundation for a more collaborative and efficient code management process.
